1Q:What are databases and what are the advantages of using them?
A: Databases are systems used to store, organize, and manage large amounts of information. Instead of saving data in random files or documents, databases help keep everything structured and easy to access. The main advantages are that they make data easier to search, update, and secure. Databases also support multiple users working with the same data at the same time, which is important for apps, websites, and businesses.

2Q:List 3 data types that can be used in MySQL and describe them briefly:
A:
INT – Used to store whole numbers (like 5, 100, or -20).
VARCHAR – Used for storing text. You set a max length (like VARCHAR(255)).
DATE – Stores dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Useful for things like birthdays or due dates.

3Q: In what situations would SQLite be a better choice than MySQL?
A: SQLite is better when you’re working on smaller projects or apps that don’t need a big server. It’s lightweight, easy to set up, and stores everything in a single file. It’s great for personal projects, small apps, or when you just want to test things locally. You don’t need to install or manage a whole database server like you do with MySQL.

4Q:Think back to what you learned in the Immersion course. What do you think about the differences between JavaScript and Python as programming languages?
A: JavaScript is mostly used for building websites and making things interactive in the browser. Python is more often used for things like data analysis, automation, scripting, and backend development. Python is known for being simple and readable, while JavaScript is more focused on how things work in the browser. 

5Q:Now that you’re nearly at the end of Achievement 1, consider what you know about Python so far. What would you say are the limitations of Python as a programming language?
A:While Python is great for learning and very readable, it can be slower than some other languages like C++ or Java. It’s not always the best choice for high-performance apps, like games or real-time systems. Also, because it’s loosely typed (you don’t always declare the data type), it can lead to bugs that are harder to catch until you run the code. That said, it’s still super useful for tons of projects—just maybe not the best fit for everything.
